# Purpose

~~I have to use the RevTex document class frequently to write submission reports, so decided to make a copy I could simply access again without having to rewrite the whole thing from scratch each time. 
This is also for the convenience of my co-writers, who can easily see where I'm at and suggest changes without needing to keep asking.~~

This repository now houses all the materials - MATLAB code, final paper writeups, existing datasets - that were used in Physics180C.
